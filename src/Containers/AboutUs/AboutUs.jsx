            At Compos, we also understand the importance of being able to recreate existing music. Our platform includes features that make it easy for cover musicians 
                to write out the structure of existing songs, so they can accurately perform and record their own versions. The platform also allows cover musicians to share 
                their arrangements with other musicians, making it easy for bands and cover groups to collaborate and perfect their performances. With Compos, cover musicians 
                have the tools they need to elevate their craft and take their performances to the next level.
